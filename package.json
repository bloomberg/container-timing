  "description": "This polyfill allows developers to support element timing on containers (like `div`s or `section`s). This will fill a limitation which element-timing is [currently unable](https://github.com/WICG/element-timing/issues/79) to do. If you're working on a component and need better heuristics of when that component has been painted you can tag it with attributes and receive events similar to [`element-timing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceElementTiming).",
